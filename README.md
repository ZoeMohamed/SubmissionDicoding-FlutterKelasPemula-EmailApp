## How Screens Work on Different Devices

  - Optimized for mobile devices, ensuring all elements are easily accessible and readable. The layout adjusts to fit smaller screens, and navigation is simplified for touch interactions.

- **Tablets**: 
  - Maintains a similar layout to mobile devices but takes advantage of the larger screen size to display more information at once, including side-by-side views of the email list and details.

- **Desktops and Browsers**: 
  - Utilizes additional screen real estate to present a more comprehensive view. Users can see the email list and details simultaneously, enhancing productivity. The layout is designed to prevent overflow, ensuring all content is visible regardless of window size.
